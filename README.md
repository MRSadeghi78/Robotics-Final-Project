# Robot-Motion-Planning
Implementing Bug2 algorithm on an omnidirectional robot in Webots. In this project, the robot uses sonar and infrared sensors, gps, camera, and deep learning algorithms ot detect obsticles and its predefined destination.

## Preview
In these videos you can see how robot will move towards the destination point in each algorithm:



## Algorithms
You can see the main idea of each algorithm in these diagrams:
